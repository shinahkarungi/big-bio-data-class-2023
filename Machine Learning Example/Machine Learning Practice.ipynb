    "## Dimensions of Your Data\n",
    "You must have a very good handle on how much data you have, both in terms of rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data Integrity:` The first and foremost reason for checking the dimensions of data is to ensure that the data is complete and accurate. The shape of the data (number of rows and columns) can give an idea of how much data is available for analysis, and can help detect any inconsistencies or missing values in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data Preprocessing:` The dimensions of data are important to determine the appropriate preprocessing steps to apply before building a machine learning model. For example, if there are too many missing values or too few data points, certain data cleaning or feature engineering techniques may need to be applied to prepare the data for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Model Training:` The dimensions of data also impact the training of machine learning models. Machine learning models require a certain amount of data to learn and generalize patterns in the data. If the dataset is too small, the model may not learn the underlying patterns in the data, and if the dataset is too large, it may lead to overfitting. Thus, understanding the dimensions of the data is crucial for selecting an appropriate model and tuning its hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Training time estimation:`  the dimensions of data can have a significant impact on the training times of machine learning models. In general, as the size of the dataset (i.e., number of rows and columns) increases, the training time of machine learning models also increases.\n",
    "This is because most machine learning algorithms require multiple passes over the data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. As the dataset size increases, the number of calculations required to process the data increases, which can result in longer training times."

    "- `Data consistency:` Checking the data types ensures that the data is consistent and in the correct format. Inconsistent data types can lead to errors or incorrect predictions during model training and testing. For example, when you keep the dates they should be in one format such as \"mm/dd/yyyy\" if they shift around you will have errors in analysis\n",

    "- `Memory optimization:` Checking data types can help optimize memory usage during preprocessing, especially when dealing with large datasets. Data types can be converted to lower memory-consuming types like integers or floats.\n",

    "- `Efficient data manipulation`: Different data types can require different manipulation techniques, and knowing the data types beforehand can save time and improve efficiency during data manipulation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `Identifying missing or erroneous data:` Descriptive statistics can help you identify if any of your data is missing or if there are any errors in your dataset. For example, you may notice that certain features have a lower count of non-null values than others, which could indicate missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Understanding the distribution of your data:` Descriptive statistics can give you insights into the distribution of your data, such as the mean, median, and mode. This information can be useful for choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithms, as some algorithms work better with certain types of data distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Detecting outliers:` Descriptive statistics can also help you detect outliers, which are data points that fall outside the expected range of values. Outliers can have a significant impact on your machine learning model's performance, so it's important to identify and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Assessing the quality of your data:` By examining the descriptive statistics of your data, you can get a sense of the overall quality of your dataset. For example, if you notice that some features have a large range of values compared to others, this could indicate that the data is noisy or that some features may be more important than others.\n",

    "Why would someone check the label distribution in an ML/AI experiment?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Class imbalance:` In some datasets, one class may be significantly more prevalent than the others. This can lead to a class imbalance problem, where the model is biased towards the majority class and performs poorly on the minority class. Checking the label distribution can help identify if there is a class imbalance problem in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Model performance:` The label distribution can impact the model's performance. If the model is trained on a dataset with a skewed label distribution, it may not generalize well to unseen data. Checking the label distribution can help ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data preprocessing:` Depending on the label distribution, different preprocessing techniques may be needed. For example, in a dataset with imbalanced labels, oversampling or undersampling techniques may be needed to balance the classes. Checking the label distribution can help determine what preprocessing techniques are needed.\n",

    "- `Data collection:` The label distribution can provide insights into the data collection process. For example, if a certain label is overrepresented, it may indicate that the data was collected in a biased way. Checking the label distribution can help identify potential biases in the data collection process.\n",

    "## Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation refers to the relationship between two variables and how they may or may not change together. The most common method for calculating correlation is Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, that assumes a normal distribution of the attributes involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "`A correlation of -1 or 1 shows a full negative or positive correlation respectively.` \n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas a value of 0 shows no correlation at all. Some machine learning algorithms like linear and logistic regression can suffer poor performance if there are highly correlated attributes in your dataset. `It is important to know the assumptions of the model you are using before using it`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The supporting reasons for checking the assumptions of a model in an ML experiment, and how it affects how you handle data in the case of a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Ensures validity of results:` Checking the assumptions of a linear regression model ensures the validity of the results. If the assumptions are not met, the results obtained from the model may not be reliable or valid. For example, if the assumption of linearity is not met, the results obtained from the model may not accurately reflect the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Helps in selecting appropriate variables:` Checking the assumptions of a linear regression model helps in selecting appropriate variables for the model. For example, if the assumption of normality is not met, it may indicate that some variables may not be appropriate for the model or may need to be transformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Improves model accuracy:` Checking the assumptions of a linear regression model can help in improving the accuracy of the model. For example, if the assumption of homoscedasticity is not met, it may indicate that the model needs to be transformed or that a different model may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Guides data preparation:` Checking the assumptions of a linear regression model guides data preparation. For example, if the assumption of independence is not met, it may indicate that the data needs to be collected differently or that some observations need to be excluded from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Provides insights into underlying data:` Checking the assumptions of a linear regression model provides insights into the underlying data. For example, if the assumption of normality is not met, it may indicate that there are outliers or that the data is skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Comparison of Assumptions between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression`\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "`Assumptions of Linear Regression Model:`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variable is linear.\n",
    "- Independence: The observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
    "- Normality: The errors follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "- No multicollinearity: There is no high correlation among the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Assumptions of Logistic Regression Model:`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linearity of the logit: The relationship between the independent variable and the logit of the dependent variable is linear.\n",
    "- Independence: The observations are independent of each other.\n",
    "- No multicollinearity: There is no high correlation among the independent variables.\n",
    "- Large sample size: There are a sufficient number of observations for each combination of the independent variables.\n",
    "- No outliers: There are no extreme observations that can influence the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it is a good idea to review all of the pairwise correlations of the attributes in your dataset. You can use the corr() function on the Pandas DataFrame to calculate a correlation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why one would consider the correlation between variables while doing machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Identify redundant features:` Correlated features can be redundant and provide similar information. Including highly correlated features in a model can lead to overfitting and decrease the model's performance. Identifying and removing these features can help reduce the complexity of the model and improve its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Suppose you are building a model to predict the price of a house based on its size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location. The number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms are highly correlated, and including both features in the model can lead to overfitting. By identifying the correlation between these two features and removing one of them, we can reduce the complexity of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Improve model interpretability:` Understanding the correlation between variables can help to explain the relationships between the features and the target variable. This understanding can improve the interpretability of the model and help to identify important features that contribute most to the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Consider a model that predicts whether a customer will buy a product based on their age, income, and education level. By analyzing the correlation between these features and the target variable, we can determine that income has the strongest correlation with the target variable. This understanding can help to explain why income is a critical factor in determining whether a customer buys a product, and improve the interpretability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Data preprocessing:` Correlation analysis can be used to identify and remove outliers and missing values in the dataset. This process can help to improve the quality of the data and the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Suppose you are building a model to predict the likelihood of a customer to churn (i.e., leave) a subscription-based service. The dataset includes missing values and outliers, which can affect the quality of the data and the model's performance. By analyzing the correlation between the features and the target variable, we can identify and remove outliers and fill in missing values, which can help to improve the quality of the data and the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Feature engineering:` Correlation analysis can help in creating new features that can improve the model's performance. For example, we can create a new feature by combining highly correlated features or by performing operations on correlated features to create a new feature that is more predictive.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Consider a model that predicts whether a student will pass a test based on their study hours, attendance rate, and average grade. By analyzing the correlation between these features, we can create a new feature by multiplying the study hours and attendance rate, which are highly correlated. This new feature can be more predictive than either feature alone, and can help to improve the model's performance."

    "# Prepare Your Data For Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms make assumptions about your data. It is often a very good\n",
    "idea to prepare your data in such way to best expose the structure of the problem to the machine\n",
    "learning algorithms that you intend to use. In this chapter you will discover how to prepare\n",
    "your data for machine learning in Python using scikit-learn. After completing this lesson you\n",
    "will know how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rescale data.\n",
    "2. Standardize data.\n",
    "3. Normalize data.\n",
    "4. Binarize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Need For Data Pre-processing\n",
    "You almost always need to pre-process your data. It is a required step. A difficulty is that\n",
    "different algorithms make different assumptions about your data and may require different\n",
    "transforms. Further, when you follow all of the rules and prepare your data, sometimes algorithms\n",
    "can deliver better results without pre-processing.\n",
    "Generally, I would recommend creating many different views and transforms of your data,\n",
    "then exercise a handful of algorithms on each view of your dataset. This will help you to \n",
    "ush\n",
    "out which data transforms might be better at exposing the structure of your problem in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps involved are as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split the dataset into the input and output variables for machine learning.\n",
    "- Apply a pre-processing transform to the input variables.\n",
    "- Summarize the data to show the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn library provides two standard idioms for transforming data. Each are useful\n",
    "in different circumstances. The transforms are calculated in such a way that they can be applied\n",
    "to your training data and any samples of data you may have in the future. The scikit-learn\n",
    "documentation has some information on how to use various different pre-processing methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fit and Multiple Transform method is the preferred approach. You call the fit()\n",
    "function to prepare the parameters of the transform once on your data. Then later you can use\n",
    "the transform() function on the same data to prepare it for modeling and again on the test or\n",
    "validation dataset or new data that you may see in the future. The Combined Fit-And-Transform\n",
    "is a convenience that you can use for one of the tasks. This might be useful if you are interested\n",
    "in plotting or summarizing the transformed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rescale Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, `rescaling refers to the process of transforming the values of a variable to a new scale`, typically to a specific range or distribution. Rescaling is often used as a data preprocessing step to prepare the data for use in a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rescaling can be achieved using various techniques, including normalization and standardization, as well as other methods such as `min-max scaling` and `log transformation`. The choice of rescaling technique depends on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rescaling is important in machine learning because it can help to improve the performance of the model by reducing the impact of features that have large values or different scales. Rescaling can also help to simplify the interpretation of the model by making the features more comparable and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Avoiding numerical instability:` In some machine learning algorithms, such as gradient-based optimization algorithms, the scale of the input features can affect the convergence of the algorithm. Rescaling the data can help avoid numerical instability and improve the convergence of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Improving performance:` Rescaling the data can improve the performance of the model, especially when using distance-based algorithms or when the features have different scales. In distance-based algorithms, the distance between two data points is affected by the scale of the features, so rescaling the data can make the distance more meaningful. Similarly, when the features have different scales, rescaling can help give equal importance to all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Reducing computational complexity:` Rescaling the data can reduce the computational complexity of some machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines. When the features have different scales, some algorithms may require more computation to converge, and rescaling can help reduce this complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Normalization:` As mentioned in the previous answer, rescaling can be used for normalization, which is a technique used to rescale data to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. Normalization can help in comparing variables that have different units or scales or when we want to give more importance to small values.\n"

    "\n",
    "Algorithm spot-checking is a process in machine learning where multiple algorithms are tested and compared on a specific dataset to identify the one that performs the best for a given task. It involves evaluating the performance of various algorithms using a set of standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score, among others. The goal of algorithm spot-checking is to find the best algorithm that can accurately model the underlying pattern in the data and generalize well to new, unseen data. By trying out multiple algorithms and comparing their performance, algorithm spot-checking helps data scientists and machine learning practitioners to identify the best algorithm for their specific task and improve the overall performance of their models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Determine the Best Algorithm:` Spot-checking allows you to compare the performance of multiple algorithms on the same dataset and select the best one for your specific task. Different algorithms are suited to different types of problems, and spot-checking helps you find the one that performs the best on your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Save Time:` Trying out multiple algorithms manually can be time-consuming and inefficient. With algorithm spot-checking, you can automate the process of testing different models, which can save you time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Improve Accuracy:` By testing multiple algorithms and comparing their performance, you can improve the accuracy of your model. This is because different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses, and by choosing the best one for your task, you can improve the overall accuracy of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Reduce Overfitting:` Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and captures noise instead of the underlying pattern in the data. By comparing the performance of multiple algorithms, you can identify the one that is less prone to overfitting and select it for your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Gain Insights:` Algorithm spot-checking can also provide valuable insights into the characteristics of your data. By analyzing the performance of different algorithms, you can gain a better understanding of the patterns and relationships within your data, which can help you develop better models in the future.\n",

    "# Chosen Model: Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Problem Representation:` Logistic regression is used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes (e.g., spam or not spam, pass or fail). The output of logistic regression is a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Linear Function:` In logistic regression, we first create a linear function by multiplying input features (x) with their corresponding weights (w) and adding a bias term (b). This is similar to linear regression but with a key difference in the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Mathematically: z = w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + ... + wn * xn + b\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Sigmoid Function:` The linear function's output (z) is passed through the sigmoid function (also called the logistic function) to convert it into a probability value between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve, which maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Sigmoid function: p = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Model Training:` To train the logistic regression model, we need to find the optimal weights (w) and bias (b) that minimize the error between predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes. This is done using a technique called gradient descent, which iteratively adjusts the weights and bias to minimize the cost function (e.g., cross-entropy loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Prediction and Decision Boundary:` Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the probability of a given input belonging to a particular class. A decision boundary is set (typically at 0.5), and if the probability is greater than this threshold, the input is classified as one class; otherwise, it is classified as the other class."

    "## Cross Validation (Model Evaluation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation is a widely used technique in machine learning to assess the performance of a model and its ability to generalize to unseen data. It is important because it helps to address the issue of `overfitting`, where a model learns the training data too well and performs `poorly on new, unseen data`. \n",
    "\n",
    ">> `Cross-validation provides a more accurate estimate of a model's performance on unseen data and reduces the risk of overfitting.`\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind cross-validation is to divide the dataset into multiple smaller subsets, called folds, and train and evaluate the model multiple times. Each time, the model is trained on a different combination of folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated until every fold has been used for testing exactly once. The performance of the model is then averaged across all iterations to provide a more reliable estimate of its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main reasons why cross-validation is important in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "`More accurate performance estimation:` By evaluating the model on different subsets of data, cross-validation provides a better estimate of the model's performance on unseen data compared to a single train-test split.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Reducing overfitting:` Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including the noise, and fails to generalize to new data. Cross-validation can help detect overfitting by providing performance estimates on different data subsets, thus encouraging the selection of a model with better generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Model selection and hyperparameter tuning:` Cross-validation can be used to compare the performance of different models or to fine-tune the hyperparameters of a single model. By comparing cross-validation scores, you can select the model or hyperparameter configuration that performs best on average across different data subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Efficient use of data:` In situations where the available dataset is limited, cross-validation allows for more efficient use of the data by training and testing the model on different subsets, ensuring that the model's performance is assessed on the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "One popular form of cross-validation is `k-fold cross-validation`, where the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is then trained and tested k times, each time using a different fold for testing and the remaining k-1 folds for training. Other variants of cross-validation include stratified k-fold, which preserves the class distribution in each fold, and leave-one-out cross-validation, where each sample is used as a test set exactly once."

    "## Model Evaluation (Cross Validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating if a model is `overfitting` based on `cross-validation (CV)` scores and training scores involves comparing the model's performance on the training set and the cross-validation set. Here's a simple guideline to interpret these scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the training score is high and the CV score is also high, the model is likely performing well and generalizing effectively to unseen data. This indicates a good balance between bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the training score is high, but the CV score is significantly lower, the model is likely overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model captures the noise in the training data and is unable to generalize well to new, unseen data. In this case, you should consider simplifying the model (e.g., using regularization, reducing the number of features, or using a less complex model) or increasing the size of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If both the training score and CV score are low, the model is likely underfitting. This occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. To address underfitting, you can try using a more complex model, adding more features, or fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "`It's important to note that comparing the absolute values of the scores may not always be informative.`\n",
    " Instead, look at the `relative difference between the training and CV scores to assess if the model is overfitting.` A large gap between the two scores is indicative of overfitting, while a smaller gap suggests a better balance between bias and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Keep in mind that cross-validation provides a more robust evaluation of model performance than a single train-test split.
