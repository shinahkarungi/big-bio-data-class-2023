    "When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer.\n",
    "In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found yourself searching before.\n",
    "Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful functions of IPython/Jupyter is to shorten the gap between the user and the type of documentation and search that will help them do their work effectively.\n",
    "While web searches still play a role in answering complicated questions, an amazing amount of information can be found through IPython alone.\n",
    "Some examples of the questions IPython can help answer in a few keystrokes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do I call this function? What arguments and options does it have?\n",
    "- What does the source code of this Python object look like?\n",
    "- What is in this package I imported? What attributes or methods does this object have?\n",
    "\n",

    "Tab completion is useful if you know the first few characters of the object or attribute you're looking for, but is little help if you'd like to match characters at the middle or end of the word.\n",
    "For this use-case, IPython provides a means of wildcard matching for names using the ``*`` character.\n",

    "PendingDeprecationWarning     Warning\n",
    "ResourceWarning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the ``*`` character matches any string, including the empty string.\n",

    "We can search for it this way:\n",
